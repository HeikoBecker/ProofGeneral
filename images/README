Icons for Proof General.

The images in this directory were made with The Gimp and Inkscape.
They were created in my spare time as a donation to the Proof General
project.  The images here are released under the Creative Commons
license, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

The Inkscape-based search icon includes portions from Andrew
Fitzsimon's Etiquette search icon (under CC 2.0).

[ Inkscape-based icons forthcoming ]


Note for developers: the sources for images have been moved
to the PG graphics repository.
