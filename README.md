# Proof General â€” Organize your proofs! 

Proof General is an Emacs interface for Coq. 

This is version 5.0.0~pre of Proof General, which relies on Coq's XML protocol to support asynchronous processing.

Please checkout the `server-protocol' branch to get these new features, and see the file HOWTO-USE in that branch for installation instructions.
