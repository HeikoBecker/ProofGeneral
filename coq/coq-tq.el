;;; coq-tq.el --- utility to maintain a transaction queue

;; modified version of tq.el from Emacs distribution

;; TODO mention returning current call
;;      handlers for partial responses

;; The main modification is that queue may contain elements that are thunks, as 
;; well as strings. That allows us to invoke the thunk just before sending 
;; its results to the process, which allows capturing state variables that 
;; may have been changed by previous responses, in particular the state-id 
;; in a <value> response from coqtop. The thunk returns a list consisting 
;; of the span associated with a Coq sentence and the sentence wrapped 
;; in XML, suitable to send to coqtop. We return the span along with the 
;; coqtop response so we can set the state id in the span metadata.
;; 

;; Another modification is that we can log the strings sent to the process.
;; That way, we see the correct order of calls and responses, which we would 
;; not see if we logged the sent strings at the time of queueing.

;; When creating the transaction queue, we pass a handler for out-of-band data.

;; Finally, the enqueue function does not take the optional delay-sending argument.
;; We always delay sending until the last response has been received.

;;; Commentary:

;; This file manages receiving a stream asynchronously, parsing it
;; into transactions, and then calling the associated handler function
;; upon the completion of each transaction.

;; Our basic structure is the queue/process/buffer triple.  Each entry
;; of the queue part is a list of question, regexp, closure, and
;; function that is consed to the last element.

;; A transaction queue may be created by calling `tq-create'.

;; A request may be added to the queue by calling `tq-enqueue'.  If
;; the `delay-question' argument is non-nil, we will wait to send the
;; question to the process until it has finished sending other input.
;; Otherwise, once a request is enqueued, we send the given question
;; immediately to the process.

;; We then buffer bytes from the process until we see the regexp that
;; was provided in the call to `tq-enqueue'.  Then we call the
;; provided function with the closure and the collected bytes.  If we
;; have indicated that the question from the next transaction was not
;; sent immediately, send it at this point, awaiting the response.
