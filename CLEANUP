Stuff to do to clean up the code
--------------------------------

Fold in changes in main PG repo - DONE

Localize all state 

Use cl-lib throughout - DONE

Consistent naming; using pg- prefix throughout?

Either update or ditch the Adapting document
We could describe how to use different protocols
Right now, all the comms stuff is in coq/, though

generic/proof-resolver.el probably doesn't need much of what's there

ditch generic/proof-shell.el, but there is code that uses it, so careful
DONE, although proof-tree, some other code still references it

Makefile.devel mentions cvs; update that to git, or ditch this Makefile?

generic/proof-easy-config is probably ditchable - DONE

Go through autoloads, see what's what, rebuild autoloads

Is generic/pg-xml.el still used? It's used in pg-movie.el, pgip.el
Bits of it are redundant with coq/coq-xml.el

in bin/proofgeneral, make it executable
remove references to other provers

remove uses of proof-trace-buffer, proof-thms-buffer?

Update mmm contrib?

What about Makefile.travis?
