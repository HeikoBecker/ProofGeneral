How to try out Proof General with the coqtop XML protocol
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Get the code from Github

The repo is at:

 https://github.com/psteckler/ProofGeneral

You should clone the repo via ssh or https.

2) Switch to the branch that supports the XML protocol

 $ git checkout server-protocol

3) In the ProofGeneral directory that was created via cloning:

 $ make

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You're probably already a Proof General user, so you'll want a way to
switch between the current distribution, and this experimental
version. Here's one way to do that on Linux, assuming you're running
bash as your shell.

In your .emacs file, add something like:

  (defun pg-xml ()
    (load-file "<path-to>/ProofGeneral/generic/proof-site.el")
    '(defun message (&rest s) nil)) 

And in your ~/.bashrc, add a line like:

  alias emacs-pg-xml="<path-to>/emacs -eval \"(pg-xml)\""

Run:

  $ source ~/.bashrc

Then, to run a Coq script foo.v:

  $ emacs-pg-xml foo.v

To run the current Proof General distribution, you can setup another
.emacs load function and bash alias:

  (defun pg ()
    (load-file "<path-to>/ProofGeneral/generic/proof-site.el"))

  alias emacs-pg="<path-to>/emacs -eval \"(pg)\""

The Proof General code is still experimental, and prints a lot of
debug messages, which may be annoying. To get rid of those, you can
remove the quote from the "defun" above (although you'll lose the
information provided by those messages).

Please note, this code is of alpha quality. Also, the most recent
fixes to Proof General have not yet been folded into the code.

If you discover a bug, please work out the steps to reproduce
it. There's a transcript of the traffic between Emacs and coqtop in
the buffer *coq-log*, which may be helpful. Please create a new
issue in the Github repo above (not in the standard PG repo).

Thanks for trying out the code!
